`ADDRESS` - Common for Agent and Server Adress (Server Address and Agent requests endpoint Address).

`REPORT_INTERVAL` - The time in seconds when Agent sent `Metrics` to the Server.

`POLL_INTERVAL` - The time in seconds when Agent collects `Metrics`.

`STORE_INTERVAL` - The time in seconds after which the current server readings are reset to disk
(value 0 â€” makes the recording synchronous).

`STORE_FILE` - The name of the file in which Server will store `Metrics` (Empty name turn off storing `Metrics`).

`RESTORE` - Bool value. `true` - At startup Server will try to load data from `STORE_FILE`. `false` - Server will create new `STORE_FILE` file in startup.

`KEY` - Static key (for educational purposes) for `Metrics` hash generation.
If the `Agent` is started with a `KEY` (`-k=...` or `KEY=""` in `.env`), then all metrics will be subscribed
by simple hash function.

`DATABASE_DSN` - postgreSQL link to connect and create data base for collecting metrics
